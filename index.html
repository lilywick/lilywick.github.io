    <h4>Like many millennials, I graduated college unsure of what exactly I wanted to do, but nonetheless convinced that I would save the world. After two years working in advertising, I accepted a job at Avon in large part because I really liked the fact that the company had a very strong social justice agenda. Avon argues that women cannot be truly empowered unless their safety and health is guaranteed, which is why it is the largest corporate supporter of breast cancer research and the anti-domestic violence initiative. Immediately after joining Avon, I signed up for the New York Breast Cancer Walk, which involves walking 39.3 miles over two days. Full disclosure: I am not what you would call “active.” Physical exertion for me begins and ends with pilates and other such mat-friendly regimes. I think this actually worked to my advantage. Everyone I emailed, using #chooseboobs as my subject line as well as social media tag, was so shocked (and probably terrified) at the thought of me attempting this that I raised almost 10 times more than I set out to – almost $15,000. This is by far the recent accomplishment of which I am most proud.</h4>
